#Simple Deserialization Script
=================================================

While i was doing Burp's lab for deserialization, the extension for deserialization stopped working. So i thought that why not create my own simple tool to automate it.

Ysoserial.jar can be downloaded from https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial

Before using, change 
1) Path of java
2) Path of ysoserial
3) User creds.


Usage:

```
python3 SDS.py

```
